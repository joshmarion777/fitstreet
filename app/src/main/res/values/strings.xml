    <string name="tv_fitstreet_cashback_confirmed_header">4.   What does it mean when the cashback is in confirmed state?</string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_cashback_confirmed">Confirmed earnings are those that have been approved as valid sales from retailers. On collecting a minimum of Rs. 250 as confirmed cashback, we can transfer the money for free to your Indian bank account by NEFT or you can use that money to purchase our own merchandise available under the FitStreet store.</string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_cashback_transaction_header">5.   How can I assure smooth cashback transaction?</string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_cashback_transaction">To enable your cashback to track successfully, we recommend that in your browser settings you permanently allow cookies, JavaScript and third party images. Clear cookies to get started. Always visit retailer links only through FitStreet and not by typing retailer website names on your browser screens. Avoid using quote references or codes provided by a comparison site as FitStreet will not receive any commission from retailers and will be unable to give cashback to you. Keep all email confirmations and documents from the retailer - just in case you need to use the information for submitting an earnings enquiry.\n
        You can always keep track of your earnings (including rewards from challenges) under the wallet section.</string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_receive_cashback_header">6.   What do I do if I do not receive a cashback confirmation for a purchase?</string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_receive_cashback"><![CDATA[If your purchase was less than 3 days ago,
    please wait a little longer. It usually takes between 4-72 hours for retailers to track sales.\n However, if your purchase was over 3 days ago, please submit a missing cashback ticket within 10 days from the date of transaction. Any missing cashback claims will not be accepted after 10 days. Sometimes, though rare, retailers fail to track a transaction on their end. After we receive transaction details from you, we can follow this up with the retailer to get your missing cashback.\n
      In order to submit a ticket, you need details such as retailer name, date and time of the transaction, transaction amount, order or transaction reference and any other information to help track your transaction.]]></string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_withdraw_header">7.   When can I withdraw my cashback value?</string>
    <string name="tv_fitstreet_withdraw">Cashback value can be withdrawn after pending status is converted to confirmed status in around 60 days. Money in pending form still needs to be completely processed before it can be withdrawn.
